# The DL1r score is a type of b-tagging score used in high energy physics, and specifically in ATLAS and CMS experiments
# at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

# "B-tagging" is the process of identifying jets that originated from b-quarks, also known as "b-jets". This is
# important because many processes of interest in particle physics, such as the production of top quarks or the Higgs
# boson, often result in b-jets, so being able to identify these jets helps physicists identify these processes.

# The DL1r algorithm is a particular type of b-tagging algorithm that uses a machine learning technique (specifically a
# type of neural network) to distinguish b-jets from other types of jets. The "DL1r" name stands for "Deep Learning
# 1-dimensional with a continuous reweighting", where "1-dimensional" means that it provides a single score for each
# jet, and "continuous reweighting" refers to a technique used to balance the different types of jets in the training
# data.

# This DL1r score can be used to discriminate between b-jets, c-jets (jets originating from c-quarks), and light jets
# (jets not originating from b or c quarks). A higher DL1r score means that the algorithm considers the jet more likely
# to be a b-jet.
