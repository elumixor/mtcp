# VV

VV stands for di-vector boson production:
- Either WW is prodiced
- Or ZZ is produced

From [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/V_particle):

In particle physics, V was a generic name for heavy, unstable subatomic particles
that decay into a pair of particles, thereby producing a characteristic letter V 
in a bubble chamber or other particle detector. Such particles were first
detected in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere in the late 1940s  and
were first produced using the Cosmotron particle accelerator at Brookhaven
National Laboratory in the 1950s. Since all such particles have now been
identified and given specific names, for instance Kaons or Sigma baryons, this
term has fallen into disuse.
