# Event Weights

- To train we need labeled data
- We get this data from the [[Monte Carlo Simulation]]
- Because of this simulation, the distribution of the data is not the same as in
  reality
- We correct for this by weighting each sample
- In the end the weighted sum of the generated events should match the sum of
  the events in reality (expected number of events should match)
