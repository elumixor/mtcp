\section{All classes vs signal and background only}
\label{sec:binary}

In \cite{severin}, the authors experimented with both multiclass and binary classification formulations. The multiclass
formulation is a direct approach where the model is trained to differentiate among all classes simultaneously. In
contrast, the binary formulation is a specialized approach where the model is trained to distinguish only between signal
and background classes. All classes, except for the signal, are treated as background. This approach is motivated by the
hypothesis that the model can concentrate more of its resources on the primary task of signal and background
discrimination.

For \cite{severin}, based solely on the reported significance, the results were quite similar\footnote{Based solely on
    significance, it is challenging to conclude which approach is superior.} for both formulations. However, our
observations suggest that when the model is trained to differentiate among all classes, it demonstrates enhanced
learning capabilities\footnote{Based on accuracy, \gls{auc}, and significance.} and can potentially extract more
information from the input data (see \autoref{fig:two-phase-training}). This approach, however, also allocates resources
towards distinguishing individual background classes, which might not be essential for the primary task of signal and
background discrimination.

Consequently, we suggest considering an alternative strategy, which we refer to as "two-phase training," to utilize the
model's resources more effectively. Initially, it would involve training the model on all classes. Once satisfactory
performance is achieved, one could transition to the binary formulation. In practical terms, this would mean no longer
penalizing the model for misclassifying among the background classes (e.g., if the true class is \ttw and the predicted
one is \ttz, the prediction would still be deemed correct since both processes are background). This strategy could
potentially allow the model to focus on the primary task of signal and background discrimination after gleaning
sufficient information from the distinctions among all classes. The model would first learn the patterns in the
underlying physics comprehensively and then hone its focus on the primary task.

The results are summarized in \autoref{fig:two-phase-training}, showcasing the progress in AUC and accuracy for
differentiating signal from background. It is evident that the multiclass formulation outperforms the binary one, and
we hypothesize that this performance could be further enhanced by the two-phase training strategy.
