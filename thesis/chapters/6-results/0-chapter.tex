\section[NN performance]{\gls{nn} performance}

We have reached phenomenal performance with FT-Tokenizer NN.

\section{Significance}

But significance is not so good. Why? We just picked a bad SR. Hehehe.

\section{Uncertainties}

Uncertainty using just the statistical uncertainty is:

$$
    \mu_{t\bar{t}H} + 0.999 /-0.999
$$

By including the systematical uncertainty, we get:

$$
    \mu_{t\bar{t}H} + 0.999 /-0.999
$$

\section{Conclusions}

We have conducted a very important research.
