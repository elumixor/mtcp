\section{\tth Process}

The \tth process is a specific type of event that occurs within the \gls{lhc}'s high-energy
particle collisions. In this process, two gluons collide, resulting in a pair of top quarks and a Higgs boson.

The \tth process is of particular interest in particle physics due to its potential to shed light on the nature of the
Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is pivotal in the \gls{sm} of particle physics, as it is associated with the Higgs
field, which gives other particles their mass. Despite its significance, the Higgs boson remains one of the least
understood particles due to its elusive nature and the difficulty involved in its detection.

In a \tth event, the Higgs boson quickly decays into other particles, making it impossible to observe it directly. Instead,
physicists must reconstruct its presence from the particles into which it decays. The top quarks, on the other hand,
have a higher lifetime, making them easier to detect. The \tth process is unique in that it allows the observation of the
Higgs boson's interactions with top quarks - the heaviest known fundamental particle - thereby providing a direct probe
into the Higgs mechanism.

The primary goal of this research is to separate \tth process events from other events, which is a challenging task given
the similarities between \tth events and certain background processes. By leveraging \gls{dl} techniques, this task can
be achieved more effectively, thereby facilitating a more detailed study of the Higgs boson and its properties.

\subsection{\lss channel}
\label{sec:lss}

\input{figures/feynman/2lss1tau}

The work at \gls{cern} is often divided into different channels, with each channel focusing on a specific final state of
interest. These channels are orthogonal, meaning that each event can only belong to one channel, preventing any overlap
in the analysis.

One such channel, and the main focus of this thesis, is the two-lepton same-sign plus one tau (\lss) ($e$, $\mu$)
channel. This specific final state arises from the decay of a top-antitop-Higgs (\tth) system, where one top quark
decays to a $W$ boson and a $b$ quark, with the $W$ boson further decaying to a lepton and a neutrino. The other top
quark also decays to a $W$ boson and a $b$ quark, but in this case, the $W$ boson decays into a pair of quarks. Lastly,
the Higgs boson decays to a pair of tau leptons, where one tau lepton decays into another lepton and two neutrinos,
while the other tau lepton decays to a pair of quarks and a neutrino. This complex series of decays results in a final
state consisting of two same-sign leptons and a hadronically decaying tau lepton, hence the name \lss channel
(\autoref{fig:2lss1tau}).

The branching ratios for these decays are approximately

\begin{align*}
    \text{Higgs boson to a pair of tau leptons: }\mathcal{B}(H \rightarrow \tau\tau)    & \approx 6.0\%   \\
    \text{Tau lepton to a $W$ boson and a neutrino: }\mathcal{B}(\tau \rightarrow W\nu) & \approx 100\%   \\
    \text{Top quark to a $W$ boson and a b quark: }\mathcal{B}(t \rightarrow Wb)        & \approx 100\%   \\
    \text{$W$ boson to an electron and a neutrino: }\mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow e\nu)     & \approx 11\%    \\
    \text{$W$ boson to a muon and a neutrino: }\mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow \mu\nu)        & \approx 11\%    \\
    \text{$W$ boson to a pair of quarks: }\mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow qq)                 & \approx 67\%\,.
\end{align*}

Given that the theoretical cross-section for the \tth process is about $\sigma_\tth \approx 500 \text{ fb}$. The
luminosity for the analyzed period (\gls{lhc} Run-2) is ${\mathcal{L} = 140 \text{ fb}^{-1}}$, the total number of expected
\tth events is approximately ${N_\tth = \sigma_\tth \cdot \mathcal{L} = 70\ 000}$.  When accounting for the
aforementioned branching ratios, the expected number of \tth events in the \lss final state is approximately reduced to

\begin{align*}
    N_{\text{\tth, \lss}} & = 2 \cdot N_\tth \cdot
    \mathcal{B}(H \rightarrow \tau\tau) \cdot
    (\mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow e\nu) + \mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow \mu\nu))^2 \cdot
    \mathcal{B}(W \rightarrow qq)^2                                                                        \\
                          & = 2 \cdot 70\ 000 \cdot 0.06 \cdot (0.11 + 0.11)^2 \cdot 0.67^2 \approx 183\,.
\end{align*}

Note that factor $2$ takes into account the two configurations where leptons have either both positive sign, or both negative sign. The
first (positive) case is presented in \autoref{fig:2lss1tau}, while the second one would have the top quark decay
into $t \rightarrow b\bar{q}q$, antitop quark decay into $\bar{t} \rightarrow \bar{b}l^-\nu$, and then from the Higgs,
$\bar{\tau} \rightarrow \bar{q}q\nu$, and $\tau \rightarrow l^-\nu\nu$.

It is a simplified calculation, but it provides a good estimate of the scale of the challenge we face in detecting the
\tth in the \lss channel. As we apply the selection criteria to the simulated data (\autoref{sec:mc}), we drop from
about 8.9M to just 32K raw events. For the \tth, this corresponds to 0.8M $\rightarrow$ 15K raw events. Note that
additional cuts (\autoref{sec:regions}) are applied, numbers here correspond to the \acrshort{sr}. In terms of
weighted events the transition is from 46K $\rightarrow$ 32.72 weighted events across all the processes, and 523.42
$\rightarrow$ 12.22 weighted events for the \tth. The details for all processes are given in \autoref{tab:class_distributions}.


\subsection{Regions in Particle Physics}
\label{sec:regions}

    \caption{Relationship between different regions.}
    \label{fig:regions}
\end{figure}

We briefly describe the notion of regions in particle physics. There are three types of regions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\gls{sr}} is where we expect the events of interest, the
          signal, to be most prevalent. It is defined by certain selection criteria that maximize the signal's prominence against
          the background. \appref{appendix:cut-expression} shows the precise definition of the \gls{sr}.

    \item \textbf{\glspl{cr}} is where we estimate the amount of background contamination
          present in the \gls{sr}. The \gls{cr} is characterized by negligible signal but a significant amount of background
          events, similar to what we expect in the \gls{sr}. By studying the \gls{cr}, we can understand and model the background in the \gls{sr}.

    \item \textbf{\glspl{vr}} are used to test the reliability of our model predictions and the \gls{mc} simulations.
          \glspl{vr} are typically chosen where neither the signal nor the background is expected to be particularly high or
          low. Any significant deviation of the observed data from our model predictions in the \gls{vr} may indicate the
          presence of a new physics process or systematic errors in our model or simulation.
\end{itemize}

These regions are not arbitrarily defined but are carefully chosen based on detailed knowledge of the physics processes
involved and the detector's characteristics.

        events in these regions are blinded.  Blinding refers to hiding the data points in the bin if signal to
        background ratio is larger than a certain threshold. A threshold of $0.3$ is used as blinding condition for
        all bins.} \end{figure}

        events generated by the \gls{mc} simulation (\autoref{sec:mc}) before and after applying the \gls{sr} selection
        criteria. For each process, the number of raw events
        and the number of weighted events are given.}

\end{table}


\autoref{fig:lep_pt_0} and \autoref{fig:lep_pt_1} show the distributions of the leading and
subleading leptons' transverse momenta inside the \gls{sr}. This type of plots (yields plots) is most common
generated by the \trex\footnote{\trex is a framework for binned template profile likelihood fits
    heavily used at CERN. The documentation can be found at \url{https://trexfitter-docs.web.cern.ch/trexfitter-docs/}.
    The code can be found at \url{https://gitlab.cern.ch/TRExStats/TRExFitter}} software. Such plots are often used to
check the modelling of the variables, catch some trivial issues early on, and compare the differences between
the different versions of the \gls{mc} production (\autoref{sec:mc}). Further plots are presented in the
\appref{appendix:yields}.

\begin{table}[htb]

    \input{figures/num_events_fakes}
    \captionof{table}{Number of fake lepton events inside the \gls{sr}.}
    \label{tab:fakes_numbers}
\end{table}

Note that the fake electron, muon and tau contributions are based on a Template Fit method\footnote{Private
    Communication, August 2023, Nello Bruscino.} using simulated shapes and overall normalization with recorded data in
dedicated selections (\glspl{cr}). Fake lepton events are not used in the \gls{nn} training.

Fake lepton events are subtracted from the simulated \gls{mc} sample, and the fake lepton events from the Template Fit
method are added. In total, there are 14.96 \tth and 40.21 background events after the preselection in the \gls{sr}.

As a general rule in the \gls{atlas} Collaboration, the recorded data must be blinded for those bins where the signal
over background ratio is above a certain threshold. This blinding avoids a bias in the analysis, and the blinding
condition is only removed after the analysis is completed and finalized, and the \gls{atlas} Collaboration gives
approval for unblinding.
