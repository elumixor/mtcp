\section{Overview of Particle Physics}

Particle physics, also known as \gls{hep}, is a field of study that seeks to understand the fundamental
constituents of matter and their interactions. This branch of physics has led to the discovery and characterization of a
multitude of subatomic particles, providing deep insights into the structure of the universe.
