\subsection{Particle Interactions and Decays}

In particle physics, interactions between particles result from the exchange of force-carrying particles, or gauge
bosons. Each of the four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear) has its
associated bosons, which mediate these interactions.

Decays are processes by which a particle transforms into two or more other particles. These are inherently probabilistic
processes, with specific probabilities associated with each possible decay path, given by the branching ratios.
